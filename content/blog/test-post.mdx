## Code Examples

Here's a simple code snippet to test syntax highlighting:

```typescript title="hello.ts"
function sayHello(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(sayHello("World"));
```

### With Line Numbers

```typescript title="utils.ts" showLineNumbers
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

export function formatUser(user: User): string {
  return `${user.name} <${user.email}>`;
}
```

### Diff Support

```typescript title="config.ts"
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // [!code --]
  apiUrl: 'https://api.production.com', // [!code ++]
  timeout: 5000,
};
```
