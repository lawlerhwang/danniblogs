# PR Title Convention

**IMPORTANT:** All PR titles MUST follow conventional commit format because we use squash and merge. The PR title becomes the commit message.

PR titles must start with a type prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, or `test:` followed by a colon and space.

Examples:
- `feat: add blog search functionality`
- `fix: resolve MDX rendering issue`
- `docs: update README with setup instructions`
