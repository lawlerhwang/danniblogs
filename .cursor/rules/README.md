# Cursor Rules

This directory contains project-specific rules for Cursor AI.

## Rules

- **coding-standards.md** - TypeScript, Next.js, React coding conventions and best practices
- **pr-conventions.md** - PR title conventions for conventional commits

Cursor automatically reads all `.md` files in this directory and applies them when assisting with code.
